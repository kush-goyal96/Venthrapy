      },
      {
        q: "How do I know if I need therapy?",
        a: "You don’t need a breakdown or a big reason. If something’s on your mind — even if you can’t name it — therapy can help you explore it.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a diagnosis to book a session?",
        a: "Not at all. You don’t need a label to deserve care. We’re here for you, with or without one.",
      },
      {
        q: "What kind of issues can I bring to therapy?",
        a: "Anxiety, burnout, relationships, grief, identity, overthinking, numbness, not knowing what you're feeling — no topic is too big or too small.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between therapy and talking to a friend?",
        a: "A therapist is trained to hold space without judgment or agenda. They help you reflect, not advise. It’s a relationship built for your healing.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I choose between a clinical or counselling psychologist?",
        a:
          "Both are trained professionals. \n" +
          "• Counselling psychologists are ideal for everyday concerns like relationships, stress, or low mood.\n" +
          "• Clinical psychologists are trained to work with diagnoses or intense symptoms. If unsure, take our optional self-assessment or message us for guidance.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer therapy to minors?",
        a: "Yes. If you're under 18, we require a signed consent form from a parent or guardian. Our team is trained to work sensitively with adolescents.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you provide therapy over text or chat?",
        a: "No. All therapy is done via video (or audio if needed) to maintain a focused, connected, and safe space.",
      },
      {
        q: "What language is therapy offered in?",

      },
      {
        q: "What if I cry or freeze in session?",
        a: "That’s okay. Tears, silence, pauses — they’re all welcome here. You don’t have to perform being okay.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need to prepare anything for my first session?",
        a: "Nothing formal. Just come as you are. You might reflect on what brought you here, but your therapist will guide you gently.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get “cured” in one session?",
        a: "Therapy isn’t a quick fix. While one session might offer clarity or relief, deeper change happens over time.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long will I need to go to therapy?",
        a: "There’s no fixed number. Some benefit from short-term support, others need a longer journey. Your therapist will check in regularly to ensure your needs are met.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I message my therapist between sessions?",
        a: "Only for scheduling or brief check-ins, depending on your therapist’s boundaries. Therapy happens during sessions to maintain presence and structure.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I call my therapist in case of an emergency?",
        a: "No. Our therapists are not crisis responders and cannot communicate outside scheduled sessions. Please reach out to a mental health helpline or emergency services in a crisis.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will my sessions be private?",
        a: "Completely. Confidentiality is at the heart of what we do. What you share stays between you and your therapist.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I don’t feel a connection with the therapist?",

          "• Within 24 hours but at least 2 hours before your session, you can reschedule (not cancel). \n" +

      },
